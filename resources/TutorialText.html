      <h1>How to play</h1> <br/>
      <p>     Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field.</p>
      <p>     During this descent, the player can move the pieces laterally and rotate them until they touch the bottom of the field or land on a piece that had been placed before it.</p>
      <p>     The player can neither slow down the falling pieces nor stop them, but can accelerate them in most versions.</p>
      <p>     The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank.</p>
      <p>     Completing lines grants points, and accumulating a certain number of points moves the player up a level, which increases the number of points granted per completed line.</p>
